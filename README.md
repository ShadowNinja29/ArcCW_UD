https://trello.com/b/ukOphim9/urbna

Seven high quality weapons with original assets, and the most in-depth customization you will ever see.

12 modders. 10 months. One big project.

Urban Decay is the product of the combined talent, effort, & creativity of some of the workshopâ€™s finest weapon-making talents.

This is no mere port - we have assembled every weapon with high quality assets that befit a modern first person shooter. Many of these assets, including all sounds and animations, are **completely original** and made specifically for GMod. That is to say - you can't find it anywhere else! Not in Call of Duty, Battlefield, or whatever shooter title you are searching for right now. Not even Modern Warfare or Cold War.

Whethere you are looking for realism, style, or just something that is fun to shoot and fun to customize, this pack will not disappoint you.

# Features:
- 7 High-quality weapons models from the Left 4 Dead 2 workshop
- Nearly 100% original sounds, animations, and attachments
- A dizzying array of barrel, receiver and caliber options unique and specific to each weapon.
- Perks, internals, ammo types, magazines, stocks, you name it, you can customize it.
- New weapon mechanics - weapon sway and malfunctioning - for that extra realism. Your attachments matter!
